      "The toilets are in the side hallway. There is also an accessible toilet and I am allowed to use it even if I don't have a disability.",
      "In church I can sit on any of the available seats. If I have a wheelchair I am welcome to sit wherever I feel most comfortable.",
      "When the service is ready to start, the person leading will say hello and tell us what is happening.",
      "During the service we will sing songs. I can stand up or sit down to sing. It is OK to move around, dance or wave a flag.",
      "After the Family Song, I will be invited to go into the side hall for kids activities. There is circle time, games, stories and a craft. It is OK to stay in the main service.",
      "After the service I can stay for a drink and a biscuit and talk to people. If I don't want to do this, that is OK and I can go home with my family when we are ready."
